# 📁 FYP Repository Formatter & PDF Generator

A **Python-powered toolset** for automating the extraction, formatting, and transformation of multi-sheet Excel files containing Final Year Project (FYP) ideas—into clean, structured `.xlsx` and `.pdf` files.  
Designed to eliminate repetitive manual work and make project idea exploration **LLM-ready**.

## 🚀 Overview

During my Final Year Project (FYP) Idea exploration, I encountered a public Google Sheet dataset from **XYZ University (2019–2023)**, containing dozens of sheets with hundreds of student FYP ideas.  
The text was not directly copyable, and navigating multiple sheets was inefficient.

This project automates the process using Python to:

- ✅ Split a multi-sheet Excel file into individual `.xlsx` files  
- ✅ Convert each `.xlsx` into a properly formatted `.pdf` ready for printing, review, or LLM processing
